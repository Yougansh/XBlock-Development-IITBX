In Video Quiz XBlock
====================

Abstract
````````

We aim to develop a XBlock for IITBX courseware which has a quiz embedded in the video lecture for evaluation.

We started with developing a XBlock which runs a YouTube video lecture (using YouTube API) and separately developing the quiz interface (using HTML, CSS, and Javascript) for the in-video quiz. Then, we integrated the two modules in the standard XBlock Structure.
